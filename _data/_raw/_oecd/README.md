Files are organized as follows:

- `collective_bargaining_coverage.csv`: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CBC downloaded on November 2, 2018.

Collective bargaining coverage rate corresponds to the ratio of employees covered by collective agreements, divided by all wage earners with right to bargaining.

- `labor_share.csv`: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?queryname=345 downloaded on October 19, 2020.

Unit labour costs measure the average cost of labour per unit of output. They are calculated as the ratio of total labour costs to real output, or equivalently, as the ratio of average labour costs per hour to labour productivity (output per hour). As such, a unit labour cost represents a link between productivity and the cost of labour in producing output. The data presented in this dataset are an output of the OECD System of Unit Labour Cost and Related Indicators which produces annual and quarterly unit labour cost measures according to a specific methodology to ensure data are comparable across OECD countries. Annual time series are presented in this dataset and detailed metadata are provided for each variable and country in regards to the methodology and data sources used. For more information on the OECD System of Unit Labour Cost and Related Indicators, see http://stats.oecd.org/mei/.


- `trade_union_density.csv`: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD downloaded on November 2, 2018.

The OECD/ICTWSS database contains information from administrative and survey data on the number of employees that are members of a trade union, the number of employees and union density defined as the ratio of union members divided by the total number of employees. For more information on sources and methods, see `UnionDensity_Sourcesandmethods.pdf`.

- `tax_revenue.csv`: https://data.oecd.org/tax/tax-revenue.htm downloaded on January 20, 2019.

Tax revenue is defined as the revenues collected from taxes on income and profits, social security contributions, taxes levied on goods and services, payroll taxes, taxes on the ownership and transfer of property, and other taxes. Total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP indicates the share of a country's output that is collected by the government through taxes. It can be regarded as one measure of the degree to which the government controls the economy's resources. The tax burden is measured by taking the total tax revenues received as a percentage of GDP. This indicator relates to government as a whole (all government levels) and is measured in million USD and percentage of GDP.

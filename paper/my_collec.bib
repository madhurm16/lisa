I develop a simple theory where labour market institutions creating wage compression in Europe also encourage more investment in technologies increasing the productivity of less-skilled workers, implying less skill-biased technical change in Europe than the US.},

In the long run, the economy resembles the standard growth model with purely labor-augmenting technical change, and the share of labor in GDP is constant. Along the transition path, however, there is capital-augmenting technical change and factor shares change. Tax policy and changes in labor supply or savings typically change factor shares in the short run, but have no or little effect on the long-run factor distribution of income.},

@article{Acemoglu2002,
abstract = {For many problems in macroeconomics, development economics, labour economics, and international trade, whether technical change is biased towards particular factors is of central importance. This paper develops a simple framework to analyse the forces that shape these biases. There are two major forces affecting equilibrium bias: the price effect and the market size effect. While the former encourages innovations directed at scarce factors, the latter leads to technical change favouring abundant factors. The elasticity of substitution between different factors regulates how powerful these effects are, determining how technical change and factor prices respond to changes in relative supplies. If the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently large, the long run relative demand for a factor can slope up. I apply this framework to develop possible explanations to the following questions: why technical change over the past 60 years was skill biased, and why the skill bias may have accelerated over the past 25 years? Why new technologies introduced during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were unskill biased? What is the effect of biased technical change on the income gap between rich and poor countries? Does international trade affect the skill bias of technical change? What are the implications of wage push for technical change? Why is technical change generally labour augmenting rather than capital augmenting?},
annote = {Acemoglu develops a framework which generalizes the existing endogenous technical change models to allow for technical change to be directed towards different factors. The firms invest in a technology complementing a particular factor. The targeted factor is determined by two competing effects and the dominance of one or another. These two effects are:
* price effect: creates incentives to develop technologies used in the production of more expensive goods (or factor), i.e. scarce factors;
* market size effect: encourages the development of technologies that have the larger market, i.e. abundant factor.

The relative strengths of those two effects are determined by the elasticity of substitution between the factors. When the latter is low, the price effect dominates. When it is high, the market size effect does. The model contains a market for technology development where a firm has a monopoly. According to the elasticity of substitution between the factors sigma, the net present discounted value of profits for the monopolist to develop one technology producing more factor i are either: increasing in i factor price when sigma{\textless}1 or increasing in i factor supply when sigma{\textgreater}1.

Acemoglu defines that two factors are gross substitutes only if the two goods are gross substitutes.

Acemoglu2002 claims that another important determinant of the direction of technical change is the form of the "innovation possibilities frontier". He uses two forms of the model: lab equipment specification and knowledge-based R{\&}D specification. The former being a special case of the latter when there is no state dependence.

Under lab equipment specification, the direction of technical change is endogenized and determined by the relative factor supply and the elasticity of substitution between factors. Acemogu defines the "weak induced-bias hypothesis" where the technology will be endogenously biased in favor of the more abundant factor, the market size effect dominates even when both factors are gross complements. He also defines the "strong induced-bias hypothesis" where the relationship between relative factor supplies and relative factor rewards can be upward sloping when {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} is sufficiently large, i.e. {\$}\backslashsigma{\textgreater}2{\$}. He notices that outside the balanced growth path, there will only be one type of innovation.

Under knowledge-based R$\backslash${\&}D, there is a potential state dependence. The results are very similar to the lab equipment specification. However, the growth rate is determined by the number of scientists. We still have price and market size effects, but also an effect through the relative cost of future R$\backslash${\&}D. When the state dependence is sufficiently high, this effect will play a destabilizing role. Under extreme state dependence, technical change is acting to equate relative factor shares and induced innovations will push the economy towards constant factor shares.

To summarize, there are two important determinants of the direction of technical change: (1) $\backslash$textbf{\{}degree of substitution between the two factors{\}}, when factors are more substitutable, the market size effect and under endogenous technical change, the more abundant factor ; (2) $\backslash$textbf{\{}degree of state dependence in the innovation possibilities frontier{\}}.

$\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}} emphasizes four main issues to its analysis: (1) the model exhibits a ``$\backslash$textit{\{}scale effect{\}}'' meaning that the growth rate of the economy increases with the population; (2) profit-motivated R$\backslash${\&}D which is not necessary the case in reality; (3) the factor supplies are given and there is no accumulation; (4) there is no empirical evidence on the degree of state dependence.

Finally, $\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}} discusses the application of its framework to different cases: the endogenous skill-biased technical change observed in the US, the directed technical change and cross-country income differences, the effect of international trade on technical change, the Habakkuk hypothesis, the labor-augmenting technical change in the long run, and, the wage push.

Over the past 60 years, the US relative supply of skills has increased rapidly and in the meantime, the college premium has also increased. Technical change is assumed to favor skilled workers and since new tasks are more complex it generates an increasing demand for skills. The model provides explanations for the skill-replacing technical change of the nineteenth century, the secular skill bias of technology throughout the twentieth, and the recent acceleration in this skill bias.

$\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}} extends his model with two countries : North (developed) and South (less developed). The latter using technologies developed by the former. However, these technologies may not be appropriated to the needs of South countries. The skill-biased technologies developed in the North due to the structure of the economy will not fully benefit to South country. Thus, the income gap will be larger than it would have been in absence of directed technical change.

$\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}} applies his model to international trade. Using the example of a closed country with relative high-skilled workforce. When this country becomes an open country, since skills are scarcer in the world economy than in this country, trade opening will increase the relative price of skill-intensive goods in the country. In this case, the price effect will dominates inducing more innovations directed at skilled workers. He notices that trade opening necessarily increases the skill premium.

Habakkuk hypothesis is that the rapid technical change in the US economy during the nineteenth century resulted from the relative labor scarcity in the US. Specifying the two factors as labor and land (not capital), $\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}} shows that his model allows for such an explanation under a sufficient complementarity between those two factors.

$\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}}'s model allows a labor-augmenting long-run technical change. However, conditions are strong. Requiring an extreme amount of state dependence in R$\backslash${\&}D and an elasticity of substitution between labor and capital less than 1.

Finally, $\backslash$cite{\{}Acemoglu2002a{\}} discusses the technological implications of a ``$\backslash$textit{\{}wage push shock{\}}'' that took place in continental Europe starting in the late 1960's. The wage push will first increase the labor share and then gradually reduce it by creating capital-biased technical change. Throughout the process, employment falls.},

abstract = {This essay discusses the effect of technical change on wage inequality. I argue that the behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates that technical change has been skill-biased during the past sixty years. Furthermore, the recent increase in inequality is most likely due to an acceleration in skill bias. In contrast to twentieth-century developments, much of the technical change during the early nineteenth century appears to be skill-replacing. I suggest that this is because the increased supply of unskilled workers in the English cities made the introduction of these technologies profitable. On the other hand, the twentieth century has been characterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies. The recent acceleration in skill bias is in turn likely to have been a response to the acceleration in the supply of skills during the past several decades.},

We calibrate the model exploiting additional information on the pace of structural change from manufacturing to services, on which the model also has predictions. We then conduct a decomposition to establish the relative importance of several potential drivers of changes in factor income shares and structural change that have been proposed in the literature.

When I modify the econometric specification to allow for biased technical change, I obtain significantly lower estimates of the elasticity of substitution. I conclude that the U.S. economy is not well described by a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function. I present estimates based on both classical regression analysis and time series analysis.

To demonstrate this, we use detailed task data and show that, when taking into accounting the spectrum of tasks within occupations, the automation risk of US jobs drops, ceteris paribus, from 38 {\%} to 9 {\%}.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes a marked change in the evolution of the U.S. wage structure over the past fifteen years: divergent trends in upper-tail (90/50) and lower-tail (50/10) wage inequality. We document that wage inequality in the top half of distribution has displayed an unchecked and rather smooth secular rise for the last 25 years (since 1980). Wage inequality in the bottom half of the distribution also grew rapidly from 1979 to 1987, but it has ceased growing (and for some measures actually narrowed) since the late 1980s. Furthermore we find that occupational employment growth shifted from monotonically increasing in wages (education) in the 1980s to a pattern of more rapid growth in jobs at the top and bottom relative to the middles of the wage (education) distribution in the 1990s. We characterize these patterns as the {\%}u201Cpolarization{\%}u201D of the U.S. labor market, with employment polarizing into high-wage and low-wage jobs at the expense of middle-wage work. We show how a model of computerization in which computers most strongly complement the non-routine (abstract) cognitive tasks of high-wage jobs, directly substitute for the routine tasks found in many traditional middle-wage jobs, and may have little direct impact on non-routine manual tasks in relatively low-wage jobs can help explain the observed polarization of the U.S. labor market.},

We find that firing costs have a larger effect on firms' propensity to fire than to hire, and (slightly) increase average long-run employment. Calibrating the model with realistic parameter values, we argue that high firing costs, slower and more uncertain growth, and lower attrition rates after the first oil shock can explain some features of employment's dynamic behaviour in the largest European countries.},

We show it is essentially related to the capital-output ratio; that this relationship is shifted by factors like the price of imported materials or capital-augmenting technological progress; and that discrepancies between the marginal product of labor and the real wage due to, e.g., labor adjustment costs or union wage bargaining cause departures from it. We also provide empirical evidence on the determinants of the labor share with panel data on 13 industries and 12 countries for 1972-93. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Job creation is often thought to be a matter of encouraging more employment on a given capital stock. In contrast, this paper explicitly deals with the long–run consequences of institutional shocks on capital formation and employment. It is shown that the usual tradeoff between employment and wages disappears in the long run. In line with an appropriation model, the estimated values for the long–run elasticities of substitution between capital and labor for Germany and France are substantially greater than one.},

To study these effects, we build a macroeconomic model on two central assumptions: monopolistic competition in the goods market, which determines the size of rents; and bargaining in the labor market, which determines the distribution of rents. Product market regulation determines entry costs and the degree of competition. Labor market regulation determines the bargaining power of workers. We show the effects of deregulation. We then use our results to discuss the political economy of deregulation, and recent macroeconomic evolutions in Europe.},

We examine several pathways by which parental status is related to offspring status, including education, labor market attachment, occupation, marital status, and health, and perform several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. We decompose differences between the two nations into that part attributable to the strength of the relationship between parental income and the child's characteristics and the labor market return to those child characteristics. We find that the relationships underlying these intergenerational linkages differ in systematic ways between the two nations. In the United States, primarily because of the higher returns to education and skills, the pathway through offspring education is relatively more important than it is in Great Britain; by contrast, in Great Britain the occupation pathway forms the primary channel of intergenerational persistence.},

Population ageing will tend to lower both labor-force participation and savings rates, thereby raising concerns about a future slowing of economic growth. Our calculations suggest that OECD countries are likely to see modest – but not catastrophic – declines in the rate of economic growth. However, behavioral responses (including greater female labor force participation) and policy reforms (including an increase in the legal age of retirement) can mitigate the economic consequences of an older population. In most non-OECD countries, declining fertility rates will cause labor-force-to-population ratios to rise as the shrinking share of young people will more than offset the skewing of adults toward the older ages. These factors suggest that population ageing will not significantly impede the pace of economic growth in developing countries.},

On the basis of a multivariate statistical analysis of the 1996 ISSP Role of Government Data Set for 14 OECD countries, we find considerable age-related differences in welfare state preferences. In particular for the case of education spending, but also for other policy areas, we see that one's position in the life cycle is a more important predictor of preferences than income. Second, some countries, such as the United States, show a higher salience of the age cleavage across all policy fields; that is, age is a more important line of political preference formation in these countries than in others. Third, country characteristics matter. Although the relative salience of age varies across policy areas, we see — within one policy area — a large variance across countries.},

This paper is concerned with the general-equilibrium interaction of appropriability and characteristics of technology - namely, the embodiment of technology in capital and capital-labor substitutability in the technological menu. Technological embodiment means that the supply of capital is effectively much less elastic in the short than in the long run, and is therefore more exposed to appropriability; technology choice implies that an attempt at appropriating capital will induce a substitution away from labor in the long run, and constitutes a mechanism to thwart appropriation. Shifts in European labor relations in the last three decades offer a good laboratory in which to explore the empirical relevance of those mechanisms. The evolution of the labor share, the profit rate, the capital-output ratio, and unemployment - which we examine more particularly in the case of France - appears highly supportive.},

Thus, industries relying on skills in which younger workers are relatively more efficient will be more productive in countries with a younger labor force and less productive in countries with an older population. Building upon the neuroscience and economics literature, we construct industry-level measures of intensities in various age-dependent skills and show that population aging leads to specialization in industries which use age-appreciating skills intensively and erodes comparative advantage in industries for which age-depreciating skills are more important.},

Complex tasks are defined as those requiring higher-order skills, such as the ability to abstract, solve problems, make decisions, or communicate effectively. We measure the task complexity of an occupation by performing Principal Component Analysis on a broad set of occupational descriptors in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data. We establish four main empirical facts for the U.S. over the 1980–2005 time period that are robust to the inclusion of a detailed set of controls, subsamples, and levels of aggregation: (1) There is a positive relationship across occupations between task complexity and wages and wage growth; (2) Conditional on task complexity, routine-intensity of an occupation is not a significant predictor of wage growth and wage levels; (3) Labor has reallocated from less complex to more complex occupations over time; (4) Within groups of occupations with similar task complexity labor has reallocated to non-routine occupations over time. We then formulate a model of Complex-Task Biased Technological Change with heterogeneous skills and show analytically that it can rationalize these facts. We conclude that workers in non-routine occupations with low ability of solving complex tasks are not shielded from the labor market effects of automatization.},

2) Greater unionization and greater wage bargaining coordination have opposite effects on inequality: conflicting effects of greater union presence on income inequality.
3) Higher minimum wage is associated with higher inequality: increase in unemployment dominates the compressed distribution of wage.
4) Effect of labor market institutions tends to be large and explains a substantial fraction of the variation across countries.
5) High capital-labor ratios are associated with higher unemployment and hence with a more dispersed distribution of income.},

abstract = {Research on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor - $\sigma$ - has been proceeding for 75 years. While there is clearly a strong case for the importance of $\sigma$ in the analysis of growth and other economic issues, much less agreement exists on the value of $\sigma$. This paper offers some perspectives on prior estimates of $\sigma$, emphasizing the fundamental tension between the short-run data that are available and the long-run parameter that is required. Estimates of $\sigma$ based on various short-run and long-run models are discussed and, while the estimates range widely, the weight of the evidence suggests a value of $\sigma$ in the range of 0.40-0.60.

(2009) and Sadahiro and Shimasawa (2002). It is, however, distinguished from them in several aspects regarding the individual utility function and the intergenerational transmission of human capital. We use the model to explore the effect of population aging on economic growth in Korea. The simulation shows that population aging causes a decrease in labor supply growth and an increase in capital stock growth, thus yielding capital deepening. The aging of the population may significantly undermine growth potential. However, the result is sensitive to the manner of intergenerational transmission of human capital. Our study shows that the mode of social transmission of human capital is quite important for long-term growth of the economy.},

abstract = {This article has examined the existing economic literature as it relates to individual and population aging. The continuation of low rates of fertility and reductions in mortality rates of the elderly has revived the interest of economists in the examination of the economic impacts of aging populations. This review highlights the most important areas of research in the literature on aging. The population of the United States is expected to age significantly throughout the next 25-to-50 years. The economic consequences of the impending age structure changes should command a high priority in both theoretical and policy-oriented research by economists. The economic influences of population aging result from individual differences in behavior over the life cycle combined with the increase in the relative number of older persons. Rigorous examination of life-cycle activity is a relatively recent development in economic analysis. Considerable work remains to be done that will enable researchers to explore the labor supply and expenditure decisions as individuals' age. The continued rise of married women's labor force participation necessitates that the theoretical framework include dual-career families. The inclusion of flexible retirement ages and better measures of health status are required to permit the analysis of policy changes that alter social security and private pensions.},
annote = {I) Population aging: its sources and impact on dependency.

Population aging : increase in the proportion of a population in the older age groups.
Reflected in the increase in a population's median age.

1) Determinants of age structure changes.

Age structure of industrialized countries today : governed primarily by a population's fertility behavior.
Population growth will tend to oscillate probably about zero growth level.

2) Dependency ratios and income transfers.

Under replacement-level fertility, projections of total dependency costs depend on the relative cost of providing benefits to the young and to the old.

Average cost of supporting dependents will be higher in a stationary population than in a growing one.

Expenditure on children is in the form of investment in human capital.
={\textgreater} Reallocation of resources toward older dependents may lower the future rate of economic growth.

Increased proportion of the national income required to support older dependents if the retirement age is allowed to decline.

II) Economic status of the elderly.

1) Income of the aged.

Rising real wages during worklife have also contributed to the increasing income of successive aged cohorts.

2) Income sources and their importance.

Social security : most prevalent source of income for aged individuals.

Composition of the income of the elderly : varies significantly with the level of income.

Share of income represented by social security benefits : declines sharply with the rising income of beneficiaries.
={\textgreater} Due to the progressivity of the benefit structure.

Proportion of income derived from other public pensions, private pensions, earnings and assets : rise steeply with increases in the level of total income.

3) Replacement rates by income sources.

As the earnings record of a worker rises, the social security replacement rate falls rapidly.

Ability of a worker to accumulate assets during worklife is a function of :
- the size of his annual earnings.
- whether his earnings were interrupted by periods of unemployment or disability.

4) Inflation and the income of the aged.

In presence of unanticipated inflation: the largest decline in wealth is for the elderly.

Consumer Price Index : used to determine changes in government benefits.
={\textgreater} May result in the elderly being under/over compensated for inflation if their buyings habits are markedly different than that of youger families.

III) Life-cycle patterns of economic activity.

1) Job performance and work capacity.

Effect of age on productivity : insignificant.

Introduction of new technologies : some portion of the older worker's human capital has become obsolete ={\textgreater} Depreciation.
Higher training costs for older workers, particularly those with lower than average education and skills.

Variation within an age group is usually larger than the producitvity differences between cohorts.

Work injuries do not increase with age : although the types of accidents involving older workers result in longer periods of disability for the older employee.

2) Age-earnings profiles.

Behavior of earnings with age is more readily observable.

After entry into the labor force, annual earnings are low.
Income of each successive age group being higher.
Earnings peak achived by 45-54 years-old.

The higher the level of education and/or skill level of the job, the later the age at which income is maximized.

Increase in income due to two phenomena :
- worker's added experience : greater for young men.
- economic growth : greater for young men.

3) Life-cycle models.

Offer a system that can incorporate the complex interactions of savings and variable retirement age, obsolesence of skills and assets, education and retirement age.

IV) Labor supply of the elderly.

1) Labor supply, retirement and inconsistencies in literature.

Measure of labor market activity: labor force participation rates and receipt of pension benefits.
It is possible for a person to be counted as retired by some of these measures, but not others.

2) Factors influencing the labor supply of elderly.

Main factors : pension systems (benefits and labor force restrictions) and health status.
={\textgreater} + interaction of both of them.

Elderly may move to part time work due to the untaxed portion of income.

Compulsory retirement : justified by increasing health problems, inflexibility to work, pay scales, etc.
Termination of seniority and job-specific skills may imply a fall in the wage offers that older workers receive.

Unemployment : unsuccessful job search induces workers to withdraw from the labor force.
={\textgreater} Labor force varies inversely with changes in unemployment rates.
Over the business cycle, older cohorts as a group may suffer a net loss in employment.

Wage change : ambiguous effect due to negative income effect and positive substitution effect.

Asset income : influence of nonwage income on the labor supply decision is unambiguously negative.

Occupation : desire to remain on the job is probably correlated with prestige and physical stress required by a particular job.

V) Pensions.

1) Social security.

Political forces in a democracy will produce a social insurance budget that is too large as judged by economic efficiency criteria.

Question concerning the solvency of the social security program : 3 sources.
i) Short-run cyclical problems : prolonged recession that reduces tax revenus and increases the number of beneficiaries.
ii) Long-run problem created by the rising structure of replacement rates due to over-indexing.
iii) Demographic pressure of the chaning age structure of the population : will increase the beneficary-worker ratio necessitating a restructuring of the tax and benefit schedule.

Payroll tax to finance social security will be shifted to labor (under nul wage elasticity).
But labor supply response and welfare changes depend not only on the tax but also on the manner in which benefits are paid to workers.

Rate of return on taxes : population aging will result in increased taxes and will lower future returns.

Impact on savings : indetermined.
- Social security wealth reduces individual savings.
- But at the same time may induce workers to retire at an earlier age and thus increasing savings per year in the labor force.

2) Private pensions.

Factors influencing coverage and vesting : length of job tenure was positively correlated with pension coverage as was the level of compensation.
Union status and size of the firm are important determinants of pension coverage.

VI) Macroeconomic response to age structural change.

Behavioral response of an individual aging assumes two interrelated forms : 
a) Reaction to the physical and psychological effects of aging.
b) Change in economic behavior over the life-cycle.

Economic reaction of a nation to population aging is two-fold :
a) response of the autonomous individual to his aging
b) reaction of a population to the collective impact of an increas in the fraction of its old members.

1) Age and productivity.

Age structure will have an impaxct on the nation's economic efficiency and rate of productivity growth.

2) Age and mobility.

Horizontal mobility : inversely related to age.
Vertical mobility : members of a growing population will be promoted more rapidly on average than members of a stationary population.

3) Age an consumption.

Aging may affect the structure of demand.
Increase in the dependency ratio : tends to increase threshold levels of some goods (food, clothing and services) but has the reverse effect on housing and durables.

4) Aging and saving.

Early retirement inceases saving.

Tendency for greater per capita capital formation is due to the cessation of population growth that eliminates the need for added capital to equip net additions to the labor force.

Carrying population aging to the point where it is stationary and stable entails a risk : fertility can be reduced to below replacement, with the result that the income transfers necessary to support the aged become burdensome and unfavorable to capital formation.},

abstract = {What are the health impacts of retirement? As talk of raising retirement ages in pensions and social security schemes continues around the world, it is important to know both the costs and benefits for the individual, as well as the governments' budgets. In this paper we use the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset to address this question in a multi-country setting. We use country-specific early and full retirement ages as instruments for retirement behavior. These statutory retirement ages clearly induce retirement, but are not related to an individual's health. Exploiting the discontinuities in retirement behavior across countries, we find significant evidence that retirement has a health-preserving effect on overall general health. Our estimates indicate that retirement leads to a 35 percent decrease in the probability of reporting to be in fair, bad, or very bad health, and an almost one standard deviation improvement in the health index. While the self-reported health seems to be a temporary impact, the health index indicates there are long-lasting health differences.},

abstract = {We study the deterioration of employment in middle-wage, routine occupations in the United States in the last 35 years. The decline is primarily driven by changes in the propensity to work in routine jobs for individuals from a small set of demographic groups. These same groups account for a substantial fraction of both the increase in non-employment and employment in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations observed during the same period. We analyze a general neoclassical model of the labor market featuring endogenous participation and occupation choice. In response to an increase in automation technology, the framework embodies a tradeoff between reallocating employment across occupations and reallocation of workers towards non-employment. Quantitatively, we find that this standard model accounts for a relatively small portion of the joint decline in routine employment and associated rise in non-routine manual employment and non-employment.},

The most important feature brought about by labor market frictions is the connection between the interest rate and the unemployment rate. Exogenous shocks (such as aging) leading to lower interest rates also imply lower equilibrium unemployment rates, because lower capital costs stimulate labor demand and induce firms to advertise more vacancies. These effects may be reinforced by increases in the participation rate of older workers, induced by the higher wage rates and the larger probability of finding a job. These results imply that neglecting labor market frictions and employment rate dynamics may seriously bias the evaluation of pension reforms when they have an impact on the equilibrium interest rate.},

We focus on five European countries and the United States and show that the trend decline in the aggregate wage share observed in these countries over much of the 1980s and 1990s partly reflects changes in the sectoral composition of the economy. The application of a fixed-weight aggregation method changes the profile of the observed wage share in a significant way: in particular there is no longer sign of an overshooting of the wage share levels of the early-1970s. Error-correction wage equations based on the adjusted wage shares generally have a better regression fit and show long-run elasticities of real wages to unemployment that vary less across countries and are substantially lower than those obtained with observed shares.},

abstract = {The effect of the spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on wages depends on both the form of aggregate production relationships and the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor. With a conventional production function involving labor, robots, and ordinary capital, an increase in robotic labor can have either a positive or a negative effect on wages. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the aggregate production relationship without measuring capital or other fixed factors explicitly, using the procedure developed by Houthakker in the 1950s. Houthakker's method is based on the probability distribution of the productivity of the variable factor. Fitting different distributions to cross-sectional data on U.S. productivity, it is shown that if the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor is greater than about 1.9, the burgeoning of AI technologies will cause a decline in aggregate wages, other things equal. For the manufacturing sector, an even smaller human-robot elasticity of substitution is likely to result in declining wages of industrial workers as robots proliferate.},

We use microdata, i.e. representative samples of 3441 and 5003 French individuals observed in 1992 and 2000. Our data provide detailed information about morbidity and allow us to observe three components of expenditures: ambulatory care, pharmaceutical and hospital expenditures. We propose an original microsimulation method to identify the components of the drift observed between 1992 and 2000 in the health expenditure age profile. On the one hand, we find empirical evidence of health improvement at a given age: changes in morbidity induce a downward drift of the profile. On the other hand, the drift due to changes in practices is upward and sizeable. Detailed analysis attributes most of this drift to technological innovation. After applying our results at the macroeconomic level, we find that the rise in health care expenditures due to ageing is relatively small. The impact of changes in practices is 3.8 times larger. Furthermore, changes in morbidity induce savings which more than offset the increase in spending due to population ageing.},

abstract = {We document that the decline in the labor income share since the 1950s has been countered by a rise in the income share of capital goods that embody information and communication technology (ICT). In parallel, there has been substantial reallocation of labor income from occupations relatively substitutable with ICT (routine) to ones relatively complementary (non-routine). These trends are consistent with the view that ICT allows for the mechanization of tasks that traditionally required labor, a process known as automation. Our calibration suggests that automation can account for half of the decline in the labor share, but that it is unlikely to be the sole driver of the decline in the routine labor income share. A representative agent framework suggests welfare gains of 4{\%}.},

@article{Elsby2013,
abstract = {Over the past quarter century, labor's share of income in the United States has trended downwards, reaching its lowest level in the postwar period after the Great Recession. Detailed examination of the magnitude, determinants and implications of this decline delivers five conclusions. First, around one third of the decline in the published labor share is an artifact of a progressive understatement of the labor income of the self-employed underlying the headline measure. Second, movements in labor's share are not a feature solely of recent U.S. history: The relative stability of the aggregate labor share prior to the 1980s in fact veiled substantial, though offsetting, movements in labor shares within industries. By contrast, the recent decline has been dominated by trade and manufacturing sectors. Third, U.S. data provide limited support for neoclassical explanations based on the substitution of capital for (unskilled) labor to exploit technical change embodied in new capital goods. Fourth, institutional explanations based on the decline in unionization also receive weak support. Finally, we provide evidence that highlights the offshoring of the labor-intensive component of the U.S. supply chain as a leading potential explanation of the decline in the U.S. labor share over the past 25 years. ; Prepared for Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, September 19-20, 2013.},

Growth is driven by capital accumulation and productivity increases fueled by public investment. The closed-form solutions of the model predict taxation and the retirement age in OECD economies to increase in response to demographic ageing and per-capita growth to accelerate.

We explore the extent to which these empirical regularities can be explained by a calibrated micro-founded, nonlinear growth model with normalized CES technology and endogenous labor- and capital augmenting technical change driven by purposeful directed R{\&}D investments. We demonstrate that dynamic macroeconomic trade-offs created by arrivals of both types of new technologies can lead to prolonged swings in the labor share (and other model variables) due to oscillatory convergence to the balanced growth path as well as emergence of limit cycles via Hopf bifurcations. Both predictions are consistent with the empirical evidence.},

abstract = {Routine-biased technological change (RBTC), whereby routine-task jobs are replaced by machines and overseas labor, shifts demand towards high- and low-skill jobs, resulting in job polarization of the U.S. labor market. We test whether recessions accelerate this process. In doing so we establish a new fact about the demand for skill over the business cycle. Using a new database containing the near-universe of electronic job vacancies that span the Great Recession, we find evidence of upskilling — firms demanding more-skilled workers when local employment growth is slower. We find that upskilling is sizable in magnitude and largely due to changes in skill requirements within firm-occupation cells. We argue that upskilling is driven primarily by firm restructuring of production towards more-skilled workers. We show that 1) skill demand remains elevated after local economies recover from the Great Recession, driven primarily by the same firms that upskilled early in the recovery; 2) among publicly traded firms in our data, those that upskill more also increase capital stock by more over the same time period; and 3) upskilling is concentrated within routine-task occupations — those most vulnerable to RBTC. Our result is unlikely to be driven by firms opportunistically seeking to hire more-skilled workers in a slack labor market, and we rule out other cyclical explanations. We thus present the first direct evidence that the Great Recession precipitated new technological adoption.},

To address this question, we develop a model with vintage capital and search-matching frictions where irreversible investment in new vintages of capital creates heterogeneity in productivity among firms, matched as well as vacant. We demonstrate that capital-embodied technological change reduces labour demand and raises equilibrium unemployment and unemployment durations. In addition, the presence of labour-market regulations (unemployment benefits, payroll taxes, and firing costs) exacerbates these effects. Thus, the model is qualitatively consistent with some key features of the European labour-market experience relative to that of the U.S.: it features a sharper rise in unemployment and a sharper fall in the vacancy rate and the labour share. A calibrated version of our model suggests that this technology-policy interaction could explain a sizeable fraction of the observed differences between the U.S. and Europe.},

For example, cognitive deficits are associated with greater impatience, whereas bequest motives are associated with less impatience. We then relate our discounting measure to key economic outcomes and find that impatience is associated with lower wealth, fewer investments in health, and less planning for end of life care.},

Declines in health commonly compel workers to retire, so the challenge is to disentangle the simultaneous causal effects. The estimation strategy employs an instrumental variables specification.

Results indicate that the retirement effect on health is beneficial and significant. Investigation into behavioral data, such as smoking and exercise, suggests that retirement may affect health through such channels. With additional leisure time, many retirees practice healthier habits. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Time preferences vary by age. Notably, according to experimental studies, senior citizens tend to discount future payoffs more heavily than working-age individuals. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that demographic change has contributed to the cut-back in government-financed investment that many advanced economies experienced over the last four decades. We demonstrate for a panel of 19 OECD countries between 1971 and 2007 that the share of elderly people and public investment rates are cointegrated, indicating a long-run relationship between them. Estimating this cointegration relationship via dynamic OLS (DOLS) we find a negative and significant effect of population aging on public investment. Moreover, the estimation of an error correction model reveals long-run Granger causality running exclusively from aging to investment. Our results are robust to the inclusion of additional control variables typically considered in the literature on the determinants of public investment.},

abstract = {This work investigates alternative theories of gravity, the solutions to their field equations and the constraints that can be imposed upon them from observation and experiment. Specifically, we consider the cosmologies and spherically symmetric solutions that can be expected to result from scalar-tensor and fourth-order theories of gravity. We find exact cosmological solutions of various different kinds; isotropic and anisotropic, homogeneous and inhomogeneous. These solutions are used to investigate the behaviour of the Universes at both late and early times, to investigate the effects of corrections to general relativity on approach to an initial singularity and to look for effects which may be observable in the present day Universe. We use physical processes, such as the primordial nucleosynthesis of the light elements, to impose constraints upon any deviations from the standard model. Furthermore, we investigate the vacuum spherically symmetric solutions of these theories. This environment is of particular interest for considerations of the local effects of gravity, where the most accurate experiments and observations of gravitational phenomena can be performed. Exact solutions are obtained for this situation and their stability analysed. It is found that a variety of new behaviour is obtainable in these theories that was not previously possible in the standard model. This new behaviour allows us an extended framework in which to consider gravitational physics, and its cosmological consequences.},

We document, however, that the global labor share has significantly declined since the early 1980s, with the decline occurring within the large majority of countries and industries. We show that the decrease in the relative price of investment goods, often attributed to advances in information technology and the computer age, induced firms to shift away from labor and toward capital. The lower price of investment goods explains roughly half of the observed decline in the labor share, even when we allow for other mechanisms influencing factor shares, such as increasing profits, capital-augmenting technology growth, and the changing skill composition of the labor force.

Has the situation changed in this decade, given the surge in imports from very low wage countries? In fact, most of this increase has been in skill-intensive goods such as computers, so that one would expect little additional impact on U.S. relative wages. However, developing countries appear to be specializing in unskilled labor-intensive niches within these industries. If so, the effect on wage inequality could still be significant. The paper develops a model and a numerical example showing that when developing countries can take over the unskilled labor-intensive portions of vertically specialized industries, the consequences can closely resemble the textbook effect. But determining the actual impact will require more finely disaggregated factor content data than are currently available.},

The relative quantity of skilled labor has increased substantially, and the skill premium, which is the wage of skilled labor relative to that of unskilled labor, has grown significantly since 1980. Many studies have found that accounting for the increase in the skill premium on the basis of observable variables is difficult and have concluded implicitly that latent skill-biased technological change must be the main factor responsible. This paper examines that view systematically. We develop a framework that provides a simple, explicit economic mechanism for understanding skill-biased technological change in terms of observable variables, and we use the framework to evaluate the fraction of variation in the skill premium that can be accounted for by changes in observed factor quantities. We find that with capital-skill complementarity, changes in observed inputs alone can account for most of the variations in the skill premium over the last 30 years.},

We propose a three periods OLG model where agents, during their lifetime, cover different economic roles characterized by different incentive schemes and time horizon. Agents' decisions embrace two dimensions: the private choice about education and the public one upon innovation policy. The theory focuses on the crucial role played by heterogeneous interests in determining innovation policies, which are one of the keys to the growth process: the economy can be discontinuously innovation-oriented due to the different incentives of individuals and different schemes of political aggregation of preferences. The model produces multiple development regimes associated with different predictions about life expectancy evolution, educational investment dynamics, and technology adoption policies.

abstract = {As shown in the 1930s by Hicks and Robinson, the elasticity of substitution ($\sigma$) is a key parameter that captures whether capital and labor are gross complements or substitutes. Establishing the magnitude of $\sigma$ is vital, not only for explaining changes in the distribution of income between factors but also for undertaking policy measures to influence it. Several papers have explained the recent decline in labor's share in income by claiming that $\sigma$ is greater than 1 and that there has been capital deepening. This paper presents evidence that refutes these claims. It shows that despite a rise in measured capital-labor ratios, labor-augmenting technical change in the United States has been sufficiently rapid that effective capital-labor ratios have actually fallen in the sectors and industries that account for the largest portion of the declining labor share in income since 1980. In combination with estimates that corroborate the consensus in the literature that $\sigma$ is less than 1, these declines in the effective capital-labor ratio can account for much of the recent fall in labor's share in US income at both the aggregate and industry level. Paradoxically, these results also suggest that increased capital formation, ideally achieved through a progressive consumption tax, would raise labor's share in income.},

abstract = {Across the demographic transition, declining mortality followed by declining fertility produces decades of rising support ratios as child dependency falls. These improving support ratios raise per capita consumption, other things equal, but eventually deteriorate as the population ages. Population aging and the forces leading to it can produce not only frightening declines in support ratios, but also very substantial increases in productivity and per capita income by raising investment in physical and human capital. Longer life, lower fertility, and population aging all raise the demand for wealth needed to provide for old age consumption. This leads to increased capital per worker even as aggregate saving rates fall. However, increased capital per worker may not occur if the increased demand for wealth is satisfied by increased familial or public pension transfers to the elderly. Thus institutions and policies matter for the consequences of population aging. The accumulation of human capital also varies across the transition. Lower fertility and mortality are associated with higher human capital investment per child, also raising labor productivity. Together, the positive changes due to human and physical capital accumulation will likely outweigh the problems of declining support ratios. We will draw on estimates and analyses from the National Transfer Accounts project to illustrate and quantify these points.},

We challenge that interpretation. Putting the new approach of "normalized" production functions at the heart of a Monte Carlo analysis we identify the conditions under which identification is feasible and robust. The key result is that jointly modeling the production function and first-order conditions is superior to single-equation approaches especially when merged with "normalization." Our results will have fundamental implications for production-function estimation under non-neutral technical change, for understanding the empirical relevance of normalization and variability underlying past empirical studies.},

Equilibrium is unique in the present model, and a sufficient condition for existence is given, requiring that there be enough 'stochastic heterogeneity' with respect to party preferences in the electorate. The validity of Hotelling's 'principle of minimum differentiation', and of 'Director's Law', are examined under alternative hypotheses concerning administrative costs of redistributions, and voter's possibilities both of abstaining from voting and of becoming campaign activists for one of the parties. The policy strategy of expected-plurality maximization is contrasted with the strategy of maximizing the probability of gaining a plurality. Incomes are fixed and known, so lump-sum taxation is feasible. However, constraints on tax/transfer differentiation between indivi-duals are permitted in the analysis.},

The second effect is assumed to operate through age-specific productivity and labour force participation. In the analysis, particular attention is paid to how population ageing impinges on the government expenditure constraint. The basic structure of the model follows the Auerbach and Kotlikoff tradition. However, the model takes into consideration directly age-specific mortality.

Based on CPS data from 1980 to 2015, we find that increasing the minimum wage decreases significantly the share of automatable employment held by low-skilled workers, and increases the likelihood that low-skilled workers in automatable jobs become nonemployed or employed in worse jobs. The average effects mask significant heterogeneity by industry and demographic group, including substantive adverse effects for older, low-skilled workers in manufacturing. We also find some evidence that the same changes improve job opportunities for higher-skilled workers. The findings imply that groups often ignored in the minimum wage literature are in fact quite vulnerable to employment changes and job loss because of automation following a minimum wage increase.},

The methodology combines searches in the MesH database of PubMed with the search in the principal journals of Health Economics. 20 primary studies were found that met the criteria for inclusion. No single pattern of results is clearly identified. Among the 20 articles, four consider income to be the principal determinant of healthcare expenditure, two of them jointly with population ageing. Six highlight population ageing, as against six others that emphasize the proximity to death. The remaining six do not focus on a specific variable, or focus on another variable, e.g. technological progress or territorial decentralization. 11 of the 20 articles calculate the income elasticity of demand, only two of them obtaining a value greater than 1, thus cataloguing healthcare expenditure as a luxury good. There is, therefore, no unanimity in the variables and econometric regressions of healthcare expenditure in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. No solid empirical evidence exists that population ageing is one of the principal determinants of healthcare expenditure, and factors such as technological progress, closeness to death and territorial decentralization of healthcare are increasingly seen as important in the development of explanatory models of healthcare expenditure.},

Even the empirical question is hardly settled, although the most recent careful study confirms the prevailing view that real-wage movements are more or less independent of the business cycle. There are really two sub questions here. The first presumes that nominal wage stickiness is the main route by which nominal disturbances have real macroeconomic effects, and asks why nominal wages should be sticky. The second focuses on real wages, and asks why fluctuations in the demand for labor should so often lead to large changes in employment and small, unsystematic, changes in the real wage. Economists address only the second of these sub questions. They do so in the context of explicit bargaining over wages and employment by a trade union and a firm or group of firms, though one could hope that the results might apply loosely even where an informally organized labor pool bargains implicitly with one or more long-time employers.},

Low-paid personnel services arise as the main factor responsible for the increase in the proportion of employment at the bottom of the wage distribution. We argue that population aging can explain the increased demand for personal services and thus the rise of employment in low-paid positions. Our argument goes as follows: goods and personal services are complementary for seniors. The decrease in the relative price of goods, induced by the progressive replacement of labor input in routine tasks by machines, is then associated with an increased demand for personal services if the proportion of seniors is increasing. We thus complement the existing literature on employment polarization by showing that demographic trends also play first order role.},

We build a simple interest group model in which political pressure is time-intensive, showing that in the political competitive equilibrium each group lobbies for government policies that lower their own value of time but the old do so to a greater extent and as a result are net gainers from the political process. What distinguishes the elderly from other political groups (and what makes them more succesful) is that they have lower labor productivity and/or that we are all likely to become elderly at some point, while we are relatively unlikely to change gender, race, sexual orientation, or even ocupation, The model has a variety of implications for the design of social security programs, which we test using data from the Social Security Administration. For example, the model predicts that social security programs with retirement incentives are larger and that the old are more "single-minded" in their politics, implications which we verify using cross-country government finance data and cross- country political participation surveys. Finally, we show that the forced savings programs intended to "reform" the social security system may increase the amount of intergenerational redistribution. As a model for evaluating policy reforms, ours has the attractive feature that reforms must be time time consistent from a political point of view rather than a public interest point of view.},

In our model, the elderly end up getting transfers from the government (paid by the young) and distortionary labor income taxes induce the retirement of the elderly.

For an elderly population of a fixed size and age-sex composition, this entails that the higher its human capital, the greater the total amount of public pensions to be paid. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the link between human capital and retiree benefits and its effect on population ageing from a demographic viewpoint. We construct an old age dependency ratio (OADR), in which each person, whether in the numerator or the denominator, is assigned the number of units corresponding to his/her level of human capital. Based on data for Italy, we study the dynamics of this human-capital-specific OADR with the help of multistate population projections to 2107. Our results show that under specific conditions a constant or moderately growing human capital may aggravate the consequences of population ageing rather than alleviate them.},

Over the same period, in many countries the labor's share of national income has declined and liberalizing labor market reforms have been implemented. This paper seeks to provide a unified account of these developments. We show that globalization, in the form of increased capital mobility, provides incentives to implement labor market reforms that raise the returns to capital and improve efficiency. Nevertheless, in a world where aggregate savings reflect life-cycle motives and are mainly performed out of labor income, the associated fall in the labor share reduces aggregate savings and the pace of capital accumulation.},

We focus on Spain and the US and show that the elasticity of substitution is above one in Spain and below one in the US. We also show that the price markup drives the elasticity of substitution away from one, upwards in Spain, downwards in the US.

abstract = {Both the recent literature on production function identification and a considerable body of other empirical work on firm expansion assume a Cobb-Douglas production function. Under this assumption, all technical differences are Hicks neutral. I provide evidence from US manufacturing plants against Cobb-Douglas and present an alternative production function that better fits the data. A Cobb Douglas production function has two empirical implications that I show do not hold in the data: a constant cost share of capital and strong co-movement in labor productivity and capital productivity (revenue per unit of capital). Within four digit industries, differences in cost shares of capital are persistent over time. Both the capital share and labor productivity increase with revenue, but capital productivity does not. A CES production function with labor augmenting differences and an elasticity of substitution between labor and capital less than one can account for these facts. To identify the labor capital elasticity, I use variation in wages across local labor markets. Since the capital cost to labor cost ratio falls with local area wages, I strongly reject Cobb-Douglas: capital and labor are complements. Now productivity differences are no longer neutral, which has implications on how productivity affects firms' decisions to expand or contract. Non neutral technical improvements will result in higher stocks of capital but not necessarily more hiring of labor. Specifying the correct form of the production function is more generally important for empirical work, as I demonstrate by applying my methodology to address questions of mis-allocation of capital.},

Different theories, however, predict different patterns: one predicts that discounting will decrease over the lifespan, so that young people will discount more than the middle aged or elderly, another suggests it will increase over the lifespan, and yet another suggests that the middle-aged will discount less than either the young or the old. We conduct a study testing these predictions. 123 respondents between the ages of 19 and 89 made a large number of time discounting decisions on both computerized and paper-and-pencil questionnaires. The results suppported the view that older people discount more than younger ones, and that middle aged people discount less than either group. This finding appears to contrast with earlier work (Green, Fry, {\&} Myerson, 1994) but, as we show, our results are remarkably congruent with that study. We conclude by considering whether our results can be reconciled with the fact that young people commit more apparently impulsive acts than do the elderly.},

Overall, the net capital share has increased since 1948, but when disaggregated this increase comes entirely from the housing sector: the contribution to net capital income from all other sectors has been zero or slightly negative, as the fall and rise have offset each other. When decomposed into a return on fixed assets and a residual share of pure profits, the fall and rise of capital income outside the housing sector in the US owes mostly to the residual: it is not paralleled by fluctuations in the measured value of non-housing capital. This observation— combined with the theory of factor substitution, and simulation results from a multisector model—casts doubt on explanations of changes in the net capital share that rely on changes in the value of capital. There is greater support in the data for narratives that emphasize cyclical and trend variation in market power.},

abstract = {This analysis explores changes in the premium for abstract relative to routine tasks both across and within occupations over time. Previous theoretical and empirical work has linked growth in the relative task premium to changes in production technology that complement abstract but substitute for routine tasks, i.e. the Routine-Biased Technical Change hypothesis. The supporting empirical literature has relied almost exclusively on repeated cross-sections of workers and single cross-sections of task content. Thus, these studies have been unable to examine the evolution of wages in response to changes in task content within occupations over time and unable to control for unobserved individual and occupational heterogeneity. In this paper, I construct a new panel of occupational task content using incumbent-updated survey data from archived releases of the O*NET database. Estimating wage effects in a model with individual and occupation fixed-effects, I find that an increase of ten percentiles in the routine task distribution corresponds with a wage penalty of −0.09 to −0.35 percentage points in 2004 and declining to between −0.42 and −2.43 percentage points by 2013. In contrast, an increase of ten percentiles in the abstract task distribution corresponds with a wage penalty of 0.42–2.27 percentage points in 2004 and declining to between 0.42 and 2.43 percentage points by 2013. In contrasting estimates with and without individual fixed-effects, I also find evidence patterns of self-selection over time that are also consistent with the Routine-Biased Technical Change hypothesis.},

Second, during this time U.S. nonproduction-labor demand did not become more elastic in manufacturing overall or in any of the eight industries within manufacturing. If anything, demand seems to be growing less elastic over time. Third, the hypothesis that trade contributed to increased elasticities has mixed support, at best. For production labor many trade-related variables have the predicted effect for specifications with only industry controls, but these predicted effects disappear when time controls are included as well. For nonproduction labor things are somewhat better, but time continues to be a very strong predictor of elasticity patterns. Thus the time series of labor–demand elasticities are explained largely by a residual, time itself. This result parallels the common finding in studies of rising wage inequality. Just as there seems to be a large unexplained residual for changing factor prices over time, there also seems to be a large unexplained residual for changing factor demand elasticities over time.},

Addressing this issue requires longitudinal survey data and estimation of age (life-cycle), period and cohort effects. Except for a few of studies based on US data, such analyses are non-existent.We use repeated cross-section survey-data for 22 countries. Respondents are classified into ten-year age-groups and birth decades, and we estimate a regression model explaining respondents' public spending preferences. When period and cohort effects are taken into account, elderly people want less education spending, and more health care and pension spending. These life-cycle effects vary considerably between countries, but are generally quite small. Preferences also appear mostly unrelated to left-right party choice. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The focus is on the interaction between imperfect competition in product markets and bargaining in the labor market. The main result is that, while a uniform intensification of product market competition increases employment, it may cause real wages to fall, in the short run as well as in the long run. This is especially likely if labor market regulations are favorable to workers. Therefore, product market and labor market regulations tend to reinforce each other politically, and compensatory fiscal transfers may be needed in order to enact employment-enhancing deregulation policies.},

Industry labor's shares comovements contribute positively to aggregate labor's share movements. These findings give us a clearer perspective on one of the stylized facts of economic growth. If the great macroeconomic ratio is meaningful, it must be interpreted in terms of long-run, offsetting shifts in “services” industries versus “goods” industries, both in terms of their labor's shares and shares in total value-added.

Labor's shares' evolution at the industry level has been unbalanced (unstable); at the aggregate level labor's share's evolution has been balanced (stable).
Reason for relative stability: the share of services in total value-added has increased.

The econometric analysis of HCE in the last eight quarters of life of individuals who died during the period 1983-1992 indicates that HCE depends on remaining lifetime but not on calendar age, at least beyond 65+. The positive relationship between age and HCE observed in cross-sectional data may be caused by the simple fact that at age 80, for example, there are many more individuals living in their last 2 years than at age 65. The limited impact of age on HCE suggests that population ageing may contribute much less to future growth of the health care sector than claimed by most observers.},

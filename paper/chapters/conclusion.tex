The literature on the labor share has emphasized the role of factors such as biased technical change or labor market institutions in shaping its changes over time. 
In this paper, I explore an alternative mechanism focusing on inter-generational conflict and policy choices. 
I build an OLG model in which labor market institutions are endogenously determined through public policy and affect the wage bargaining. 
Using this model, I analyze the impact of demographic dynamics on labor share's long-term dynamics in France and the United-States. 
Numerical simulations are able to replicate the data for both countries since the 1970s.
% I use the argument developed by \cite{Caballero1998} where firms shifted away from labor as a response of worker's ability to obtain a relatively high labor share. Workers and unions are able to do so due to labor market institutions.

%% Mechanisms

%I highlight the different determinants and channels through which demographic dynamics affect the labor share.
%The model is able to replicate data for France and the United-States. 
Model predictions suggest that the decline of the labor share during the last decades was driven by cohort-size effects. 
For France, the baby-boomers cohort seems to drive public policy and thus the way in which national income is allocated between labor and capital.
When the baby-boomers cohort enters on the labor market, they shape labor market institutions in their favor because they face an unemployment risk, as opportunistic political candidates implement the policy desired by this cohort. 
These more protective labor market institutions raise workers' outside option, enables unions to bargain greater wages, and induce firms to use more capital as long as factors are gross substitutes.
The unemployment rate rises and so does the output per worker, offsetting the increase in the wage rate. 
Therefore, the labor share declines over the end of the twentieth century. 
Thereafter, the baby-boomers retire and trigger the opposite mechanism. 
Although the public policy shrinks the outside option of workers within the wage bargaining which should reduce wages and raise employment. 
The capital stock has sharply increased due to massive savings of the baby-boomers when they were young. 
The important available capital stocks partially thwart the reverse mechanism and the labor share does not recover its past level.
The model predicts a slight resurgence of the labor share for the next decades in France and a stagnation in the United-States.

%% Results
Counterfactual decomposition suggest that the survival rate dynamics have a larger impact on the labor share than the population growth dynamics. I also decompose this impact between two channels: the direct cohort-size effect and the indirect cohort-size effect. The former dominates for France when the baby boomers are young, while the latter takes the lead once this cohort retires. Although the labor share declined due to public policies implemented by baby boomers, they managed to increase their after-tax income through redistribution. An increase of the retirement age should decrease the labor share in the following decades due to the over-accumulation of capital and the raising political power of the youth. However, the labor share is expected to be greater in the very long-run.

%% Main assumptions
The two main hypothesis of the paper concern the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor and the right-to-manage specification for the wage bargaining. Recent estimates suggest that this elasticity may be greater than one (see \citealt{Karabarbounis2014}) but others have found it below one, particularly for the United-States (see, for example, \citealt{Antras2004}; \citealt{Chirinko2008}). Moreover, I do not include any form of biased technical change within the model. This is voluntary in order to develop an other theory on the labor share's decline based on demographic dynamics. It could be the case that biased technical change is also driven by demographic dynamics through the \textit{grability} of workers to seize part of the rent. This grability may be generated by some cohorts which are sufficiently numerous to shape labor market institutions in their favor and therefore in favor of labor. I leave the investigation of a potential endogenous biased technical change induced by demographic dynamics for further research.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Quantitative analysis</h1>
<p>This section provides a quantitative analysis of the model, with three main objectives: to reproduce the labor share dynamics observed over the period 1970 to 2010, to produce model predictions and to understand the transmission channels of demographic effects on the labor share. Based on analytical results, I compute quantitative predictions for France and the United-States.</p>
<div id="calibration" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Calibration</h2>
<p>One period in the model corresponds to 40 years in the data. Following the methodology of <span class="citation">Gonzalez-Eiras and Niepelt (<a href="references.html#ref-Gonzalez-Eiras2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> to simulate an OLG model, I compute four sequences of model predictions with a period length of 40 years each. Periods of the first sequence corresponds to 1970, 2010, 2050, …; for the second sequence to 1980, 2020, 2060, …; for the third sequence to 1990, 2030, 2070, …; for the fourth sequence to 2000, 2040, 2080, …. When reporting time series predictions, I list the four sequences in a single time series.
With a period length of 40 years, agents are considered as young between 20 and 60 years of age and as elderly thereafter.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> I compute the old-age dependency ratio from the data as the number of old people divided by the number of young people (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p_t/n_t \equiv N_t^o/N_t^y\)</span>). Then, the population growth rate at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is computed using the ratio between the number of young households in period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> relative to the number of young households in the previous period of the sequence (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(n_t = N_t^y/N_{t-1}^y\)</span>).

<!-- Unemployment and redistribution -->
In the model, labor supply is inelastic and there is no distinction between unemployed and inactive young individuals. Unemployed agents in terms of the model specification correspond to all agents that do not work. However, in high-income countries, such as France and United States, inactive individuals also benefits from redistribution. Therefore, I treat inactive individuals as unemployed and the redistribution is captured through unemployment benefits <span class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span> in the model.
I compute the unemployment rate such that <span class="math inline">\(u_t = 1 - emp_t/N^{15-64}_t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(N_t^{15-64}\)</span> is the working age population.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>
<!-- \textbf{details in the Appendix (to be written)}.  -->
Then, I compute labor such that <span class="math inline">\(L_t=(1-u_t)N_t^y\)</span>. I normalize <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span> to their 1970 values. As a consequence, the capital-to-labor ratio <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span> is also normalized and is equal to 1 in 1970. Then, <span class="math inline">\(N_t^y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_t^o\)</span> are normalized such that <span class="math inline">\(u_t\)</span> matches the data in 1970.</p>
<!-- Sigma estimation - Parameters to calibrate -->
<p>Once all stock variables are normalized, I calibrate the seven remaining parameters <span class="math inline">\(\lbrace \phi, \sigma, \gamma, \alpha, \omega, \beta, A \rbrace\)</span>. Table <a href="quantitative.html#tab:param">3.1</a> summarizes parameters for both countries.
% Parameters table
The first parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> corresponds to the capital share in 1970. Because the capital-labor ratio is normalized (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(k_{1970} = 1\)</span>), the labor share <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in 1970 is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1-\phi\)</span>, allowing me to determine <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>. I set the relative bargaining power of the union <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> to 0.5. Hence, I assume that neither the representative union nor the representative firm have any other advantage in the bargaining apart from their respective outside options. I also set the discount rate at 0.669 in line with the literature.</p>
<p>The main parameter of the model is the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. I estimate it using a combination of the first order conditions of the profit maximization. Details of the estimation in <a href="app-C">appendix C</a>. I obtain 1.279 and 1.234, respectively, for France and the United States. According to the estimation, both input factors are gross substitute. These estimates are in line with <span class="citation">Karabarbounis and Neiman (<a href="references.html#ref-Karabarbounis2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> who use cross-sectional data on 50 countries over the period 1975-2012 to find an elasticity greater than 1 and on average around 1.28 in their baseline estimates.</p>
<p>Then, I have three remaining parameters that are deduced. The relative ideological spread-out <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is set such that the model prediction matches the capital-to-labor ratio <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in 1970. The preference for government health expenditure <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is set to match the tax rate <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> in 1970. Lastly, the scale parameter of the production function <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is set with grid-search to match the average labor share between 2008 and 2012 for each country.</p>
<p>Due to initial labor share values, the parameter distribution <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> which correspond to the capital share in 1970 is larger in the United States than in France. Moreover, the relative per-capita political influence of old households <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is also greater. This deduced parameter suggests that young generations have less political weight in the United States compared to France. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is lower than one for France. It implies that French youth voting behavior is more sensitive to policy changes compared to elderly. French households have a much greater preference for government health expenditure <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Finally, the scale parameter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is ranged between 20 and 30 for both countries.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The model reproduces the trend in the data for both countries.
<!-- United-States -->
For the United States, the model tends to overestimate the labor share in 1980 and 1990 and underestimate it in 2000.
<!-- Explanations / References ? -->
However, model predictions capture the global trend of the labor share over the period.
<!-- France -->
For France, the dashed curve is the model prediction with a capital-labor elasticity of substitution of 1 in 1970-1980 and about 1.321 thereafter. The scale parameter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is also changed to 23.891 for France. The initial calibration of the model, as in section <a href="quantitative.html#calibration">3.1</a>, is not able to reproduce the large decline in the labor share between 1980 and 1990. This may be explained by factors not considered in the model.
<!-- Firing cost : Bentolila and Bertola -->
I model the workers outside option within the wage bargaining using only unemployment benefits and the tax rate but other labor market institutions may have played a role in firms’ employment policies during this period. For example, in my framework, there is no firing cost. <span class="citation">Bentolila and Bertola (<a href="references.html#ref-Bentolila1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span> argue that firing costs have an effect on firms’ propensity to hire and fire, and thus on employment levels. Further, they also find that firing costs slightly increase average long-run employment. Subsequent to the oil shock, firms were not able to fire as they would have due to high firing costs.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> They reduced employment with attrition, thus the process took time and the employment remained higher than it should during some years. In addition, most of the employment security policies were introduced between the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. Here again, these protections may be the result of the baby-boomers generation operating a political pressure to secure employment. Although, I do not integrate it in the model. Then, France during the 1980s has started to implement policies in order to make the labor market more flexible. For instance, short term contracts have been introduced in 1979. To summarize, the labor market institutions in France were tremendously different before and after the 1980s. The reason why the model prediction does not reproduce the labor share in the data owes to the calibration of the model that is in line with the labor market institutions after 1980, but not before. Another way to think about it, in terms of the model, is to suppose that the capital-labor elasticity of substitution was much smaller before 1980.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Therefore, the representative firm was constrained and not able to substitute labor by capital as much as the model predicts.
In line with the above arguments, I investigate whether there is a change in the regime of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> over this period. Details of the methodology are provided in <a href="app-D">appendix D</a>. I find that such a break has occurred during the 1980s in France.</p>
<!-- Transition Mechanism analysis -->
<p>To highlight the mechanisms of the declining labor share, it is necessary to look at the variations of determinant variables.
Figure <a href="quantitative.html#fig:dev7010">3.3</a> displays the deviation from the 1970’s value of determinant variables in percentage.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:dev7010"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.3: Deviation from the initial value of the determinant variables
</p>
</div>
<p>The equilibrium of the economy is determined by the interaction of the wage bargaining and the voting. Both processes take place simultaneously. The demographic context over this period is presented in figure <a href="quantitative.html#fig:demo">3.1</a>. The population growth <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> slightly exceeds the increasing survival rate <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> between 1970 and 2000. Thus, the old-age-dependency ratio <span class="math inline">\(p_t/n_t\)</span> remains roughly constant. With a decline in France in 1980 due to the massive entry of the baby-boomers in the labor force. The old-age-dependency ratio starts to increase between 2000 and 2010 due to a steady population growth but a sharply increasing survival rate. This increase is also due to the baby-boomers’ cohort starting to retire. As a result of this demographic context, the youth political weight <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t\)</span> was above its 1970’s level until 2000 in both countries.</p>
<p>As the youth’s political weight rises and because they desire more redistribution, the tax rate <span class="math inline">\(\tau_t\)</span> increases. Due to the opportunistic behavior of political parties, pro-youth policies are implemented. In the model, pro-youth policies correspond to pro-labor policies and are translated in terms of unemployment benefits in order to insure the unemployment risk. Thus, the unemployment benefits share in government revenue increases at the cost of the government health spending share in government revenue. These policy changes interact with the wage bargaining because they affect the outside option of the young agents. Pro-youth public policies motivated by a higher youth political weight leads to an increase of the unemployment benefits and a decline of the disposable income rate <span class="math inline">\((1-\tau_t)\)</span>. These two variables determine the outside option <span class="math inline">\(b_t/(1-\tau_t)\)</span> within the wage bargaining. The decrease of the denominator exceeds the increase of the numerator. Thus, the net effect on the outside option is positive and allows workers to bargain a greater wage <span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span>. The gain in net wage <span class="math inline">\((1-\tau_t)w_t\)</span> exceeds the one in unemployment benefits per capita <span class="math inline">\(b_t\)</span>. Hence, employment is even more worth as unemployment in terms of utility, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(dX_t &gt; 0\)</span>. Due to the ability of workers to bargain a greater wage, the representative firm shifts away from labor. This behavior is permitted by two features of the model. First, the right-to-manage specification of the wage bargaining enables the firm to hire and fire as much as wanted. Second, the capital-labor elasticity of substitution <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is greater than unity for both countries. Thus, both input factors are gross substitutes. The firm is able to substitute labor with capital for a given output level. This behavior leads to a decline of the number of workers <span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span> because the labor cost (i.e. the wage) has increased. Notice that the substitution effect is more vigorous in France because of the relatively higher elasticity of substitution <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The French economy has a faster growth in capital stock <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span>, while French firms are able to substitute relatively more labor with capital. Thus, the number of workers becomes lower than its 1970’s level in France. While the United-States manage to slightly increase its labor factor. As a consequence, the US output <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span> grows faster.
The slowdown in employment has consequences on the labor market.
This slowdown in employment directly raises unemployment in France by reducing the number of workers. Furthermore, the effect is all the more tremendous because the labor force <span class="math inline">\(N_t^y\)</span> grows due to the baby-boomers’ arrival. The United-States also know a growing population but the impact on unemployment is much weaker due to the increasing number of workers, as discussed above.
The dynamics of the production function affects the determinants of the labor share.
Due to the fact that both input factors are gross substitute, the output-per-worker <span class="math inline">\(Y_t/L_t\)</span> increases when the capital-per-worker <span class="math inline">\(k_t\)</span> does so. This increase exceeds the one of the wage. As a result, the labor share declines.
Let us summarize the mechanisms over this period. The baby-boomers change labor market institutions in their favor due to their relatively high political weight. It raises the outside option of workers, giving more bargaining power to the union who is able to bargain greater wages. The cost of labor becoming too high, the firms decide to shift away from labor. The fact that both input factors are gross-substitutes allows firms to substitute labor with capital. The shift away from labor engenders an increase in output per worker which thwarts and exceeds the wage gain. Thus, the labor share declines.

<p>The model predicts that the labor share should continue to decline after 2010 in both countries. However, France should face a slight rise in 2030 up to 66.1% before shrinking again. While the US labor share should remain stable around 62.6 % between 2010 and 2040 and then follows the same pattern.

</div>
<p>The demographic context over the period 2010-2080, as presented in figure <a href="quantitative.html#fig:demo">3.1</a>, is roughly the same for France and the United-States in terms of dynamics. Although the magnitudes are not similar. The population growth <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> faces a sharp decline between 2010 and 2050 before stabilizing thereafter. Meanwhile, the survival rate <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> grows by around 4% per decade. Thus, the old-age-dependency ratio increases up to 2050, more in France than in the United-States. Once the population growth becomes stable, the ratio still grows but at a lower rate. This aging of the population is mainly due to the baby-boomers’ retirement. As a result, the youth political weight never gets back to its 2010’s level and will strongly decline up to 2050 for both countries.</p>
<!-- The story is the opposite of the period 1970-2010. -->
<p>The young political weight <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t\)</span> sharply declines due to the aging of the population. Thus, opportunistic political candidates favor old individuals who desire less redistribution, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\partial\tau_t / \partial \eta_t &gt; 0\)</span>. Pro-elderly public policies are implemented. In terms of the model, it is translated by an increase of the health spending share in government revenue at the cost of the unemployment benefits one.
These policy changes interact with the wage bargaining because they affect the outside option of young households.
Pro-elderly public policies leads to slightly weaken the outside option <span class="math inline">\(b_t/(1-\tau_t)\)</span> within the wage bargaining for both countries between 2010 and 2050. Workers are no longer in position to bargain greater wages and have to concede a wage cut. But the declining wage goes along with a lowering of the tax rate which diminishes the impact on the net wage. Hence, having a job between 2010 and 2050 is worth less in terms of utility than it was in 2010. In both countries, the outside option rises over the period 2050-2080 and so does the bargained wage. This increase is mainly due to the disappearance of baby-boomers. Thus, the age-related conflict within the public policy becomes relatively more in favor of the youth again.
As the wage decreases between 2010 and 2050, the representative firm has incentive to hire. Thus, the labor <span class="math inline">\(L_t\)</span> does increase over this period. Meanwhile, the capital stock <span class="math inline">\(K_t\)</span> has increased due to savings <span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span> of the previous periods. Thus, both factors increase and so does the output <span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>. After 2050, France and the United-States diverge in their trajectories. On one hand, the US capital stock rises due to high savings of the previous periods.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> This rise is strong enough to foster the representative firm to hire workers. Thus, the substitution mechanism does not operate. On the other hand, the increase of the French capital stock does not follow the same exploding pattern. The french representative firm, as during the end of the twentieth century, shifts away from labor and decreases the number of workers. This divergence also appears on the labor market.
The labor force <span class="math inline">\(N^y_t\)</span> is roughly constant over the whole period and France is even below its 2010’s level. Thus, variations in the number of workers mainly drives the unemployment ones. The unemployment rate decreases in the United-States over the whole period. It falls down to 1.69% by 2080 against 44.6% in 2010. Here again, the sharp increase of the capital stock fosters employment until almost full-employment. The French unemployment rate decreases until 2050 before to slightly rise a bit and stabilize itself around 26.9% in 2080.
French and US workers experience a minor reduction of their wage <span class="math inline">\(w_t\)</span> between 2010 and 2050 and so does the output per worker <span class="math inline">\(Y_t/L_t\)</span>. The latter being greater than the former, the French labor share slightly increases. The US labor share remains constant because both variations compensate. After 2050, both labor shares decline to reach 62% and 59.8%, respectively for France and the United-States. While their respective levels in 2010 were 65.1% and 62.5%.</p>

<div id="counterfactual" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Counterfactual and aging effect decomposition</h2>
<p>So far, I have highlighted the different mechanisms through which the age structure of the population affects economic variables and therefore the labor share. I now consider the previous model’s prediction as the benchmark prediction. For the French case, I envisage the model specification with a break in the regime of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. To summarize, demographic changes are due to two determinant variables in the model : the population growth <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> and the survival rate <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span>. These variations may affect the labor share through two channels : the direct cohort effect and the indirect cohort effect <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t\)</span>.</p>
<p>I make counterfactual predictions in order to quantity the respective role of each channel. The idea is to neutralize either a determinant of the demographic change or a channel through which the labor share is affected. The intuition behind the counterfactual is to observe what would have happened in terms of model predictions if this effect/channel was neutralized. By comparing a counterfactual simulation to the benchmark one, I can quantify its extent. I proceed in two steps. First, I examine the impact of the different determinants of demographic changes (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> versus <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span>). Second, I investigate through which channels it occurs (i.e. direct versus indirect).</p>
</div>
<div id="srpg" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Survival rate and population growth effects</h2>
<p>To neutralize the impact of the survival rate <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span>, I assume that it remains at its 1970’s level. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(p_t = p_{1970}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1} = p_{2010}\)</span>. Population size is recalculated such that <span class="math inline">\({N^o_t}^\prime = N_t^o\times\frac{p_{1970}}{p_t}\)</span>. Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t = \frac{n_t}{p_{1970}}\frac{1+\alpha p_{2010}}{\omega}\)</span>.
<!-- ^[For the first sequence of the model: 1970, 2010, 2050,... . The expected survival rate $p_{t+1}$ in 1970 is not equal to $p_{1970}$ but to $p_{2010}$. This exception is done in order to match the benchmark simulation in 1970 and thus share the same fixed point. Otherwise, $\eta^{\text{bench.}}_{1970} \neq \eta^{p}_{1970} \Rightarrow k^{\text{bench.}}_{1970} \neq k^{p}_{1970} \Rightarrow \theta^{\text{bench.}}_{1970} \neq \theta^{p}_{1970}$, where $^\text{bench.}$ stands for the benchmark simulation and $^p$ for the constant survival rate simulation.] -->
The other demographic variables (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(n_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N^y_t\)</span>) follow the time series of the benchmark simulation. The initial capital stocks of the four sequences are also recalculated such that <span class="math inline">\(K_0^\prime = \frac{1+\alpha p_t}{p_t}\frac{p_{1970}}{1+\alpha p_{1970}} K_0\)</span>.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The methodology is analogous to neutralizing the impact of the population growth but with <span class="math inline">\(n_t = n_{1970}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\({N_t^y}^\prime = N_t^y\times\frac{n_{1970}}{n_t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t = \frac{n_{1970}}{p_t}\frac{1+\alpha p_{t+1}}{\omega}\)</span>.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Finally, a last counterfactual is made to neutralize both effects.

</div>
<p>To interpret the role played by each demographic variable, I compare each counterfactual time series to the benchmark one. For instance, let us start with the impact of the survival rate in France. I look at the dashed curve with respect to the solid one. This curve corresponds to the counterfactual where the survival rate <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{t+1}\)</span> remain at their 1970’s levels. So, if the survival rate would have not changed, then the labor share would have followed the dashed curve pattern.
<!-- The blue curve lies below the red one between 1980 and 2020 and above thereafter. Therefore, the survival rate dynamic had a positive impact on the labor share between 1980 and 2020 and a negative one thereafter. -->
The dashed curve lies below the solid one. Therefore, the survival rate dynamic has a positive impact on the labor share in both countries.
The way to interpret the other counterfactuals is similar.
The dash-dotted curve remains above the solid one until 2050 for France and 2030 for the United States. Until these years, the population growth dynamic has a negative impact on the labor share and a positive one thereafter.
Finally, the dotted curve which corresponds to the counterfactual where both effects are neutralized is below the benchmark simulation. Since 1970, all demographic dynamics have led to increase the labor share with respect to what it would have been without these dynamics.
However, this representation is tediously legible. Therefore, I compute the distance between the benchmark labor share and each counterfactual labor share. Using the Chasles’ relation within an affine space at each point in time, it is possible to isolate the extent of each effect.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Figure <a href="quantitative.html#fig:decomp-pgsr">3.7</a> displays the labors share’s gap between the benchmark and the counterfactuals in percentage points.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>As mentioned above, the survival rate effect has kept the labor share relatively high in both countries. Another way to think about that is to consider demographic dynamics in terms of cohort sizes. Until 2010, if the survival rate had been held constant, then the massive increase in the population of young households due to the baby-boomers’ presence would have generated an even larger decline of the labor share. However, the aging population (i.e. the increase of the survival rate) has thwarted part of this fall. Notice that the difference with the counterfactual is less than 1% in the case of the United-States. It suggests that the aging phenomenon over this period is a larger determinant of the labor share in France compared to the United-States.
<!-- After 2010, the explanation power of the survival rate falls and the distance between the benchmark simulation with respect to the counterfactual shrinks. It corresponds to the fact that demographic variations are not as wide as during the end of the 20th century. -->
The analysis of the determinants only reveals part of the explanation. It is also necessary to look at the channels that affect the labor share.</p>

<p>The methodology to interpret this figure is similar to the one of the figure <a href="quantitative.html#fig:counter-pgsr">3.6</a>. The dash-dotted curve corresponds to the direct cohort effect. For both countries, this curve is below the benchmark curve until 2010 and above thereafter. It means that the demographic dynamics’ net impact through the direct channel is positive on the labor share until 2010 and negative thereafter. Looking at the dashed curve, it is slightly above before 2000 and largely below thereafter. The net impact of the indirect cohort effect is negative up to 2000 and positive subsequently. However, this representation is also tediously legible. Therefore, I isolate the extent of each channel with the same methodology as before.

<p>The direct cohort effect is positive when the baby-boomers are young and after becomes negative. While the indirect cohort effect has the opposite pattern. The direct cohort effect dominates the indirect one until 2010 before to become less influential. Until 2010, if the demographic variables had been held constant, then the relatively high political power of the youth due to the baby-boomers’ presence would have generated an even larger decline of the labor share. However, the aging population was mainly driven by the increasing survival rate which has thwarted part of the fall. Notice that, here again, the difference with counterfactual is less than 1% in the case of the United-States. It suggests that the aging phenomenon over this period is a larger determinant of the labor share in France compared to the United-States.
<!-- May be for the Summary -->
After 2010, so once the baby-boomers’ cohort retires, the model predicts that the indirect cohort effect (i.e. the decline of the youth political power) should exceed the direct one. This is directly related to the mechanism analysis of section <a href="quantitative.html#pred1080">3.3</a>. The baby-boomers and more generally the old households becomes the winners of the age-related conflict within the public policy over this period. Thereby, they reduce the workers’ outside option which leads to a wage cut or more precisely to a wage stagnation. The labor cost remains constant while the capital available in the economy accumulates. It generates an incentive for the representative firm to hire more workers. As a result, the labor share increases.

<p>The main determinant of the aging phenomenon is the survival rate. On average, it explains 54.5% for France and 78.1% for the United-States of the impact on the labor share over the period 1980-2010. This decomposition persists thereafter. However, the channel decomposition does not. Between 1980 and 2010, demographic dynamics affect the labor share mainly through the direct channel in France. While the indirect one is dominant in the United-States. On average, the share explained by the direct cohort effect is about 53.1% for France and 38.2% for the United-States. However, over the next period, the direct cohort effect is not the dominant channel anymore in France. It falls to 20.3%, suggesting that the indirect cohort effect becomes the main carrier of the demographic dynamics on the labor share. In contrast, it remains relatively stable in the United-States, at around 35.7%.</p>

<li id="fn25"><p>An implicit assumption of the model is that the retirement age is constant (this assumption is discussed in section <a href="discussion.html#discussion">4</a>. The average French effective retirement age was 67.8 in 1970 and has declined to 59.3 in 2010. In the US it has gone from 68.4 to 65.6 over the same period (data from the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/emp/average-effective-age-of-retirement.htm">OECD Database, Ageing and Employment Policies - Statistics on average effective age of retirement</a>). I suppose, as an approximation, that agents retire at 60 years-old to match the period lengths of the calibration. Such an assumption should not affect the voting outcome because almost-retired agents may anticipate their future situation once they vote. However, there could be implications in terms of labor supply.

Thus, the initial capital stocks for the first periods of the four sequences becomes <span class="math inline">\(K_0^\prime = \frac{1+\alpha p_t}{p_t}\frac{p_{1970}}{1+\alpha p_{1970}} K_0\)</span>. Notice that a change in the survival rate <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span> should also affect the aggregated disposable income of young households in <span class="math inline">\(t=-1\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\((1-\tau_{-1})w_{-1}(1-u_{-1})+b_{-1}u_{-1}\)</span>. However, I do not consider this source of change. Notice also that the term <span class="math inline">\(N_{-1}^y\)</span> does not change because <span class="math inline">\(N_{-1}^y = \frac{N_0^o}{p_0} = \frac{{N_0^o}^\prime}{p_{1970}}\)</span>.<a href="quantitative.html#fnref33" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

# Labor Share and Aging Population - Fabien Petit

<p align="justify"><b>Abstrac</b> : I study the impact of the age structure of the population on the labor share in highincome countries. I use an OLG model in a framework with probabilistic voting and wage bargaining which captures the link between population aging and income allocation between capital and labor. Young and old generations do not earn the same type of income and therefore have opposite objectives when they vote to determine the public policy. This age-related conflict affects the public policy instruments, notably the out-of-work options of young agents, and thus their outside option within the wage bargaining process. Aging affects the economy through two channels, a direct cohort effect due to the cohort sizes and an indirect cohort-effect, working through the public policy choices. Numerical simulations for France and United-States indicate that the model can replicate the data. They also suggest that the baby-boomersâ€™ cohort has driven the labor share dynamics.</p>

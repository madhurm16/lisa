# Inter-generational conflict and the declining labor share - Fabien Petit

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract</b>: The age structure of the population has received little attention as a determinant of the labor share. This paper argues that demographic dynamics in high-income countries affect the labor share in two different ways: directly through the labor supply and capital accumulation, but also indirectly through public policy. I use an OLG model in which a generational conflict arises because young and old individuals have different income sources and opposite objectives in terms of public policy. The youth face unemployment risk and use their political weight to raise the unemployment benefit, while the old favor health expenditures. This tension over the public budget allocation has consequences for wage bargaining and thus for the labor share. Numerical simulations for France and the United States indicate that the model can replicate the data and that boomers' cohorts have driven the observed decline of the labor share.</p>
